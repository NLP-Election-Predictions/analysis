## Reddit EDA

**Overall Context:** Reddit is a social network that has a specific set of users that are likely unique to the platform. At the start of this project, we were not overly familiar with the posting patterns of the Reddit community, especially within the different political groups. Given this, we had to do some basic EDA to understand what were the guidelines and trends around Reddit posts, what were the differentiating words between the political ideologies, etc.

**Project description:**


## Reddit Overview
**Reddit Score:** For each post, there is a score based on "upvotes". This is graphed below for the Conservative, Liberal, and Moderate groups.
