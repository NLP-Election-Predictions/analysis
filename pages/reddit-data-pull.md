## Reddit API Pull

**Overall Context** While many social media sites have some kind of API to pull user-created content, Reddit had advantages in a few specific areas. First, the API was completely free and well-documented. Second, the goal of our project is to identify the ideological belief of people posting content. On most user platforms, this would be difficult, subjective, and potentially invasive. However, on Reddit, people are anonymous and join groups to create posts on the social network. This can be useful for our experiment because these groups can be aligned with political identity.
